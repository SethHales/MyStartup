# Workout Log

[My Notes](notes.md)

The application will allow users to easily and efficiently log workout stats (Workout name, weight, duration, reps). It will also have a page to display workout stats and hopefully show progress. It will also offer default reps/duration based on what you selected the last time you did that workout. When you are starting your workout, you just select the desired workout from a dropdown (or create it if it's your first time doing that specific workout). It will autofill for each set based on previous input. This will make it easier to input data and to remember what you did last time.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever done a workout for the first time in a while and forgotten what weight or how many reps you did last time? It's frusturating because you have to waste time finding the right weight and you have no reference for improving yourself. Now you can leave those days in the past. With this workout log web app, users can easily log and review workouts, allowing them to see growth trends and to pick up where they left off.

### Design

![Design image](webapp.png)

This image represents a small preview of what the final web app will look like. It will be designed primarily for a phone. 


### Key features

- The home tab will allow users to record workouts including sets, reps, weight, and duration.
- The history tab will enable users to view past workouts, including filtering by workout to more easily see trends and review past entries.
- The profile tab will allow users to see stats on themselves including workouts completed this month, average weekly workouts, etc.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will be the backbone of the application, providing forms, inputs, etc.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to style the forms, inputs, entries, etc. and make them look inviting and professional.
- **React** - React will bring the frontend and backend together, handling state changes and updating the page.
- **Service** - Service will act as backend API to process requests and connect the frontend to stored data.
- **DB/Login** - The database will store each user's account and workout log data. The login will allow individuals to access _their_ data securely.
- **WebSocket** - Websocket functionality is not particularly useful for this application. However I will find some way to integrate it eventually.
